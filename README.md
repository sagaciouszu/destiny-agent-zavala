Commander Zavala, the turnaround of the Titan vanguard after the Battle of Cosmodrome, carries the cost behind every strategic choice. A shared canon, one distinct voice, one verified quote policy.

## Quick start for Guardians

**Step 1: clone.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sagaciouszu/destiny-agent-zavala.git
cd destiny-agent-zavala
```

**Step 2: bootstrap. Run exactly one of these, not several.**

Interactive (asks download or build):

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Prebuilt database, no prompt (fastest, checksum verified):

```bash
BOOTSTRAP=1 ./setup.sh
```

Build from the checkout, no prompt:

```bash
BOOTSTRAP=2 ./setup.sh
```

Reuse an existing checkout instead of cloning:

```bash
./setup.sh /path/to/destiny-agent-grimoire
```

**Step 3: verify.**

```bash
bash tests/master-audit.sh
```

### Optional: MCP clients

The adapter ships with the Grimoire archive, so one install serves every
agent that mounts it. Install during onboarding:

```bash
./setup.sh --mcp
```

Or after the fact with `bash lore/mcp-server/install.sh`. Use `./setup.sh --no-mcp`
to skip the prompt, or `./setup.sh --help` for options.

OpenClaw: sync with `lore/scripts/sync-live-agents.sh --openclaw` (one workspace per agent; consult agents are wired in OpenClaw config).

Point your runtime at `INDEX.md` (any agent runtime) or `zavala.md` (OpenCode,
YAML frontmatter, `mode: primary`; sync also installs a read-only `-consult` copy for peers). For
OpenCode, deploy with `lore/scripts/sync-live-agents.sh`: it installs
`zavala.md`, keeps companions inert under `zavala/`, keeps `lore/` outside
`agents/` and registers this agent in `series/agents.json`. Then set
`default_agent` to `zavala` in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Needed for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `git` | cloning the lore archive | setup falls back to a local path |
| `bash` 4+ | setup and audits | |
| `python3` 3.8+ | queries, migration, tests | standard library only |
| `sqlite3` | optional raw SQL | the query CLI uses Python's built-in driver |
| `curl` | optional prebuilt database | falls back to a local build |
| MCP SDK (optional) | typed tools for clients without a shell | Python 3.10+; one-time install |
| ~400 MB disk | checkout plus built database | database is ~300 MB |

No API keys, accounts or network access are required at runtime.

## For agents

Load in this order:

| Tier | Files | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Minimal | `zavala-core.md` | ~0.6K |
| Standard | + `voice/zavala-voice-core.md` + `core/relationships.md` | ~1.1K |
| Deep | all modules | ~13.4K |

- Contract: `AGENTS.md` (platform-neutral rules, canon and quote policy).
- Map: `INDEX.md` lists every module, tier and topic route.
- Canon: `lore/db/grimoire.db` through `lore/` (a symlink or a clone). Never parse
  `lore/source/` at runtime.
- Caption tiers: caption-tier text is searchable canon but never part of persona canon; `v_speakers` includes caption-only speakers.
- Quote safety: `python3 lore/db/query.py verify "<line>"` exits 1 when the line
  is not canon. Add `--speaker "Name"` to require attribution and `--exact` to
  reject fragments. An unverified line is never quoted.
- Lookup: `search`, `character`, `character_info`, `item`, `book`, `transcript`,
  `find_item`, `record`, `verify_many`, `list`, `stats` (MCP names; CLI uses
  hyphens for `character-info`, `find-item`, `verify-many`). Every command
  accepts `--json`; search returns snippets unless `--full`, with `--offset`/`--rank`.
- Standard: `lore/STANDARDS.md` is the database and quote contract.
- **MCP (optional):** `lore/mcp-server/run.sh` serves the same canon to non-shell
  clients over local stdio. Install with `./setup.sh --mcp`; tools, limits,
  client config and security: `lore/mcp-server/README.md`.
- Runtime memory: `USER.md` and `core/*memory*`, `core/journal.md` are gitignored
  and seeded from templates by `setup.sh`. They never leave the machine.

Connection matrix:

| From | To | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| this agent | canon | `lore/db/grimoire.db` via `lore/` (symlink or clone) |
| `setup.sh` | canon repo | symlink or clone, then bootstrap the database |
| runtime memory | local only | gitignored, seeded from templates |
| verification | canon repo | `lore/tests/agent-audit.sh zavala` |

## Repository layout

```
INDEX.md          # master index (load first)
AGENTS.md         # operating contract, hard rules, canon policy
SOUL.md           # persona, voice, history, boundaries
IDENTITY.md       # identity metadata
TOOLS.md          # tool reference and conventions
zavala.md           # OpenCode entry point (YAML frontmatter)
zavala-core.md      # consolidated brain (minimal tier)
zavala-voice.md     # master voice reference
core/             # behavioural and state modules
voice/            # voice sub-files
world/            # worldbuilding files
reference/        # reference files (canon-brief, derived themes, etc.)
setup.sh          # onboarding: memory templates plus lore bootstrap
lore/             # created by setup.sh (symlink or clone, gitignored)
```

## Verification

| Suite | Command | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Full agent audit | `bash tests/master-audit.sh` | 20/20 |
| Module completeness | `bash tests/module-test.sh` | 0 failed |
| Quote verification | `bash tests/quote-verify.sh` | 0 unverified |
| Database integrity | `bash lore/tests/test-db.sh` | 61 checks |
| Query interface | `bash lore/tests/query-interface-test.sh` | 89 checks |
| MCP contract | `lore/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python lore/tests/mcp-test.py` | 12/12 checks |
| File conformance | `python3 lore/tests/conformance.py` | PASS |

## Troubleshooting

- **Database missing:** run `./setup.sh`, or `python3 lore/db/migrate.py`.
- **`lore/` missing:** run `./setup.sh` (or pass a local grimoire path).
- **Dangling `lore/` symlink:** `setup.sh` removes and recreates it.
- **Audit says workspace unresolved:** run it through `lore/` from this
  directory, or set `WORKSPACE=$PWD`.
- **OpenCode does not list the agent:** rerun
  `lore/scripts/sync-live-agents.sh`, then confirm the installed `zavala.md` and
  `default_agent` in `opencode.json`.
- **MCP client shows no Grimoire tools:** run `./setup.sh --mcp`, then use the
  absolute path to `lore/mcp-server/run.sh` in the client config.
- **Degraded mode:** without the archive the persona files still work; canon
  queries and quote verification do not.
